1;Biotic Rifle;Ana’s rifle shoots darts that can restore health to her allies or deal ongoing damage to her enemies. She can use the rifle’s scope to zoom in on targets and make highly accurate shots. While Ana does relatively less damage compared to other snipers, the Biotic Rifle allows Ana to switch back and forth from the roles of combatant to healer.;The Biotic Rifle shoots darts that will heal allied heroes or damage enemy units, depending on what it hits. The dart is a fast moving projectile if fired from the hip, and a hitscan shot if firing while scoped.;https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/hero/ana/ability-biotic-rifle/icon-ability.png;1;0
2;Sleep Dart;Ana fires a dart from her sidearm, rendering an enemy unconscious (though any damage will rouse them).;"After a short delay, Ana fires a fast moving dart from her sidearm. An enemy hit is stunned for a few seconds, but the effect is broken in 0.5 seconds after the target takes damage. 
This is best used against large targets or enemies very close for you so you can guarantee a hit, or when Ana and her opponent are alone to prevent opponents from being roused by fire. 
Certain abilities, including ultimates, can also be stopped or interrupted with this Dart.";https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/hero/ana/ability-sleep-dart/icon-ability.png;1;0
3;Biotic Grenade;Ana tosses a biotic bomb that deals damage to enemies and heals allies in a small area of effect. Affected allies briefly receive increased healing from all sources, while enemies caught in the blast cannot be healed for a few moments.;On activation, Ana throws an arcing projectile that explodes on impact. Any ally caught within the splash radius are healed and any enemy takes damage. Allies also receive increased healing from all sources for a few seconds, while healing effects on enemies does nothing, for the same duration. This can be dangerous against already wounded enemies, especially those who would normally be able to heal themselves (like Bastion or Roadhog).;https://blzgdapipro-a.akamaihd.net/hero/ana/ability-biotic-grenade/icon-ability.png;1;0
